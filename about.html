            <p>
                On August 2023, St. Mary's College of Maryland was approached by Parisa Rinaldi to complete a website used for positive environmental justice and information.
                In her vision, Chesapeake Community Connect came to be with the assistance of SMCM's computer science students, split into the Research & Development Team
                and the Quality Assurance Team.

            <p>
                Chesapeake Community Connect aims to showcase the resilience of the Chesapeake region through a user-friendly platform,
                where community members can share information on a spectrum of initiatives, each contributing to our collective ability to thrive amidst change.
                From ecological restoration to placemaking and racial healing, our platform serves as a dynamic hub for collaborative learning.
                We aim to inspire innovation and cultivate a deeper understanding of the diverse resilience work contributed within our communities.
